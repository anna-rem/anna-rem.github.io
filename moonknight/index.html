                    <p>Marc Spector is a former United States Marine and mercenary with dissociative identity disorder.
                        During his childhood, Spector's brother Randall drowned in a cave while they were playing,
                        starting
                        a strenuous and spiteful relationship with his mother, who frequently abused him. To find
                        comfort
                        within himself, Spector's psyche formed an alter known as Steven Grant, who had no memory of
                        Spector's trauma. While he was on a mission in Egypt, Spector was shot by his partner Raul
                        Bushman,
                        but he was saved by Khonshu, who transformed him into his Avatar and the vigilante Moon Knight.
                        Soon
                        after, he fell in love with and married Layla El-Faouly. After his mother's death, the Grant
                        alter
                        resurfaced and relocated to London to become a museum worker, with Spector occasionally taking
                        over
                        the body to operate as Moon Knight.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-8 text">
                        <p>Grant found himself in the middle of a conspiracy where a cult led by Arthur Harrow intended
                            to
                            release Ammit, so he teamed up with his wife and Spector to stop him. Whenever Grant
                            summoned
                            his
                            suit, he took the form of Mr. Knight. During their search for Ammit's tomb, Grant had
                            complications
                            with Spector, with the latter wanting to disappear after they would defeat Harrow. Arriving
                            at
                            the
                            tomb, Spector was shot and killed by Harrow, after which he was transported to the Duat. As
                            Grant
                            discovered Spector's traumatic past, he fell into the Duat, resulting in Spector being able
                            to
                            pass
                            on to the Field of Reeds. Spector was able to rescue Grant by sharing his balanced heart
                            with
                            him,
                            and returned to life through the Gates of Osiris. </p>
                        <p>Reuniting with Khonshu, Moon Knight and Mr.
                            Knight, along with El-Faouly and help from their mysterious third alter, managed to defeat
                            Harrow
                            and prevent Ammit from enacting her judgment worldwide. In exchange for defeating Ammit,
                            Spector
                            and
                            Grant were seemingly freed from Khonshu's servitude. However, their third alter, Jake
                            Lockley,
                            began
                            fronting and continued to serve Khonshu as his Avatar, and executed both Harrow and Ammit.

                    <h2>Creating Process</h2>
                    <p>Writers on the series, with an archeologist specializing in Egyptian tombs consulting with
                        the writers, likened the series to the Indiana Jones franchise while exploring
                        Egyptology, two aspects that were a large part of Slater's pitch given that they wanted to tell
                        a "dark, complex story" mixed with "big, fun, supernatural, Amblin-style magic". Slater said
                        he wanted the series to have a similar tone to Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Ghostbusters
                        (1984), and bring some horror aspects and monsters to the MCU. He wanted to push the limits with
                        how dark a Marvel series could be, which Feige and Marvel Studios were supportive of. The
                        Mummy (1999) was also an inspiration. Feige said there was a clear difference in tone
                        between Moon Knight and the other Marvel Studios Disney+ series released at that point, adding
                        that the studio worked with Disney+ to push the boundaries on how much of Moon Knight's
                        brutality they could present in the series.</p>


                    <p>Executive producer Grant Curtis said the series explored identity and "finding one's true
                        self",
                        adding that Grant and Spector would look to "reconcile portions of [their] past, present and
                        potential future that [they don't] necessarily agree with". Isaac believed the series would
                        be
                        "experiential" for viewers to connect with "the psychological horror of not knowing what's
                        happening and the slow revelations of the truth" that came with portraying the character's
                        DID.
                        Slater added that the creatives took the series' depiction of mental health seriously,
                        researching the disorder and aiming for Moon Knight to have a positive portrayal and message
                        regarding mental health.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-6 text">
                        <p>Feige said title character's mental illness was a unique aspect of the series, which
                            primarily
                            focuses on his psychological trauma. Dr. Paul Puri, a board-certified psychiatrist and
                            an assistant clinical professor at UCLA, served as a consultant for the series regarding its
                            depictions of mental illness. Diab did caution that though the creatives were respectful
                            of dissociative identity disorder (DID), the series still exists in a fictional,
                            supernatural
                            world and some elements were "over-dramatize[d]". He suggested using reflections to portray
                            the conversation scenes between Grant and Spector, which became a recurring theme of Moon
                            Knight. The series draws on the character's more modern interpretations in the comics
                            regarding DID, such as each identity losing a sense of time when not in control. Each
                            episode's end credits conclude with a message encouraging viewers to visit the website of
                            the
                            National Alliance on Mental Illness to learn more about DID. Jeff Lemire and Greg
                            Smallwood's run in the comics served as primary inspiration for the series.</p>

                        <p>Grant's costumes were meant to evoke the "coolness" of Brixton but with some elements
                            "off",with Kasperlik finding vintage shirts in New York for the character, and later
                            incorporating a "clunkier shoe to weigh this character down" and a Chore coat. Spector
                            has a
                            "desert look with a tactical, utilitarian and lighter costume". He also has a hoodie and
                            vest
                            with multiple functions which was foreshadowing for Moon Knight's cape effect. Arthur
                            Harrow's costumes are "monk-like" inspired by real-life cult leaders, while El-Faouly has a
                            more
                            athletic look with Cairo and London influences. Harrow has Ammit's death prayer
                            inscribed on his bracelet, while El-Faouly's Egyptian touches are subtlety featured in her
                            jewelry. El-Faouly also has teases throughout the series hinting at her becoming the Scarlet
                            Scarab, such as her pants being the same print as when she is in the Scarlet Scarab suit.
                            Most of El-Faouly's costumes were custom-made, despite their contemporary appearance.</p>

                                        unknowingly has in his possession. As he attempts to escape, he has several
                                        blackouts and
                                        hears a mysterious voice in his head before waking up in his home. Grant
                                        realizes that two
                                        days have passed since he went to sleep. He finds a hidden phone and keycard in
                                        his
                                        apartment and receives a call from the most frequent number in the phone's call

                                        named Layla who addresses him as Marc. The next day at work, Grant is confronted
                                        by Harrow
                                        who reveals that he is a servant of the Egyptian goddess Ammit. Grant escapes
                                        from Harrow
                                        but is forced to remain at work that night on his own to make up for being late.

                                        summons a jackal-like creature to attack Grant, but his "reflection" asks to

                                        their body. Grant agrees, transforming into a cloaked warrior who kills the

                                        Grant's existence, before being arrested by police officers working for Harrow.

                                        reveals that he was Khonshu's previous avatar until he chose instead to follow
                                        Ammit. He
                                        explains that he wants to use the scarab to find Ammit's tomb and resurrect her
                                        so she can
                                        purge humanity of evil by wiping out everyone who has committed or will commit

                                        suit of his own to fight the jackal, but is overpowered and allows Spector to
                                        take control.
                                        Spector kills the jackal but loses the scarab to Harrow. Khonshu threatens to
                                        claim Layla as

                                        Egyptian gods and their avatars to warn them of Harrow's plans, but Harrow

                                        denies the accusation. Hathor's avatar, Yatzil, tells Spector to find the
                                        sarcophagus of a
                                        medjay who knew of the location of Ammit's tomb. Layla finds Spector and takes
                                        him to meet
                                        with Anton Mogart, an acquaintance who owns the sarcophagus. Harrow arrives and
                                        destroys it,
                                        forcing Spector, Grant, and Layla to fight off Mogart's men and escape into the
                                        desert.
                                        Grant assembles some of the sarcophagus fragments into a star map, but it is two
                                        thousand
                                        years out of date. Khonshu uses his powers to briefly turn back the night sky to
                                        the correct
                                        night, allowing Grant and Layla to find Ammit's tomb. The other gods imprison
                                        Khonshu in an
                                        ushabti for this, leaving Grant and Spector's body without Khonshu's powers.

                                        memories that she
                                        suggests they explore together. Grant sees a memory of Spector's younger brother
                                        Randall
                                        drowning and Spector's mother blaming him for it, while Spector shows Grant how
                                        he became
                                        Khonshu's avatar while on a mission with his partner Bushman, who murdered
                                        Layla's father.
                                        Spector and Grant convince Taweret to help them return to the living world so
                                        they can stop
                                        Harrow, and she steers the boat towards the Gates of Osiris. Spector reluctantly
                                        explains
                                        that he unknowingly created Grant as a result of their mother's abuse. Grant and
                                        Spector
                                        reconcile with each other, but their scales fail to balance and hostile spirits
                                        attack them,
                                        dragging Grant into the Duat where he turns to sand. The scales balance and
                                        Spector finds
                                        himself in the Field of Reeds.

                                        Harrow kills the avatars of the other Egyptian gods and frees Ammit. Layla finds
                                        Khonshu's
                                        ushabti and releases him. Spector refuses to stay in the Field of Reeds and
                                        returns to the
                                        Duat to rescue Grant. With Taweret's help, they escape through the Gates of
                                        Osiris and
                                        awaken in their body. Khonshu re-bonds with them, restoring their powers. Layla
                                        discovers
                                        that Ammit can be re-bound by multiple avatars and agrees to become the
                                        temporary avatar of
                                        Taweret. They join Spector, Grant, and Khonshu in fighting Harrow and Ammit.
                                        Harrow
                                        overpowers Spector and Grant, but they experience a blackout during which time
                                        they somehow
                                        defeat Harrow. Spector and Layla seal Ammit in Harrow's body, imprisoning her,
                                        and Khonshu
                                        urges Spector to execute Harrow and Ammit. Spector refuses and orders Khonshu to
                                        release him
                                        and Grant from their service. The pair find themselves in the "hospital", where
                                        they reject
                                        the vision and choose to continue their new life protecting the world. In a
                                        mid-credits
                                        scene, Harrow and Ammit are killed by Jake Lockley, Spector's third alter, who
                                        is still
                                        working with Khonshu.
